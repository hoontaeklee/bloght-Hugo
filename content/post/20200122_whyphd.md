# Why do a PhD?

1. I like to do the PhD-related activities.
   - Studying
   - Working in nature
   - Analyzing and computing
   - Writing
   - Presenting
   - Educating

2. I want to learn the ecosystem modeling at a deep level.
3. I like the liberal atmosphere of academic community.
   - Open discussion
   - Less strict working time
4. I like jobs with a PhD than ones with a bachelor's or Master's degree.



# Why do a PhD <u>abroad</u>?

1. There are potential advisors whose experience well aligns with what I want to study.
2. They have established programs for training young researchers.
3. They have a pleasant research environment. I can more concentrate on my own research, not on irritating stuffs such as administrative works.
4. I could be more connected to the international research community.
