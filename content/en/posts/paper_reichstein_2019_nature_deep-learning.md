## 7 February, 2020 (Reichstein, Nature, Deep learning)

Reichstein, M., Camps-Valls, G., Stevens, B. et al. Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven Earth system science. ***Nature*** 566, 195â€“204 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0912-1

- **Question**:
  1. How have machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning, been applied to Earth system science and what is the future direction of the application?
- **Context**:
  - Our ability to produce a deluge of data outpaces our ability to assimilate the information.
  - The advance in computing system, statistical and machine learning modeling have combined with the plethora of Earth system data to create a new avenue of modeling: deep learning. 

- **Answer**
  1. Machine learning approach (such as deep learning) have successfully been applied to many problems in Earth system science.
  2. Machine learning and the physical models can complement each other, creating a new way of modeling: **hybrid modeling.**
  3. **Strengths of the hybrid modeling**
     -  Improving parameterizations: finding optimal values and pertinent patterns (e.g. using ML-derived parameters instead of the pre-defined PFTs).
     -  Replacing a physical submodel; many submodels are of semi-empirical, where the functional form has little theoretical basis.
     -  Analysis of model-observation mismatch: ML can help to identify, visualize, and understand the patterns of model error, which allows us also to correct model outputs.
     -  Constraining submodels
     -  Surrogate modeling: ML can be used for faster simulation.

- **Implication**:
  - Deep learning and other ML algorithms have promising potential to be used for Earth system science.
  - Hybrid modeling, which integrates physical- and data-driven modeling, is recommended.

- **Unanswered**:
  - -

- **Comment**: 
  - **Bayesian framework** is effective in quantifying uncertainties or in tracing the propagation of them.
  - I think that **Reichstein is a great writer**.
