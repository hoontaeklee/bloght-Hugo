## 21 January, 2020 (Brugnera, GCB, Liana)

di Porcia e Brugnera, M, Meunier, F, Longo, M, et al. Modeling the impact of liana infestation on the demography and carbon cycle of tropical forests. **_Global Change Biology_**, 2019; 25: 3767– 3780. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14769

- **Question**:

  1. How much does integrating lianas into the ED2 influence the estimates of forest carbon cycle?

  - The authors **hypothesized** that the impact of lianas on carbon uptake by forest would be **larger in the secondary forests** than in the old-growth forests since lianas showed high density in young forests.

- **Context**:

  - **Lianas (woody vines) have been proposed** as a possible cause of tropical forest structural changes, which limits our understanding of how tropical forests respond to perturbations and quantifying their contribution to the global carbon cycle.
  - **Despite** the demand for inclusion of lianas in models, no single dynamic global vegetation model so far includes lianas.
  - **ED2 is a suitable model** for examining the influence of lianas on carbon cycle because the density of lianas changes with the succession stage of the forest, which demography models take into consideration.

- **Answer**

  1. Liana negatively affected the above ground biomass of early- to mid- successional trees and favored shade-tolerance trees.
     - These were because lianas were treated as a pioneer and light-demanding species in ED2.
  2. The effect of introducing lianas was correlated with liana density.

- **Implication**:

  - Liana could influence the carbon cycle and the structure of forests, although this paper included some debatable assumptions and had limited observations on lianas.

- **Unanswered**:

  - How does **drought stress** affect the simulation results with lianas?
    - ED2 used in this study could not consider the water stress effect (and below-ground competition between different growth forms).
  - **More data** on lianas are needed. For example, lianas display a variety diversity of growth forms, climbing mechanisms, dispersal types, leaf photosynthetic properties, and allocation patterns.

- **Comment**: 

  - The authors did a great job for incorporating lianas into the ED2 with careful considerations of allometry, light competition, and demography.
  - The lianas brought a large change in above ground biomass because the authors assumed that lianas less allocate biomass to their stems. However, **this assumption may not be true**; Smith‐Martin et al. (2019) explained that **mature lianas and trees had a similar proportion of biomass investment to stems** and comply with the same allometric scaling law. This contradictory result may introduce wholly different results to the simulation with lianas.
  - **I like** the opening of the discussion; it say **the value of the modeling experiment**: to enable to investigate the effect of a treatment on variables which are usually not or cannot measured.
  - Also, this study indirectly showed that **abundant measurements are indispensable** for formulating and parameterizing the model; the authors had difficulties in determining the characteristics of lianas such as climbing mechanism and biomass allocation.
