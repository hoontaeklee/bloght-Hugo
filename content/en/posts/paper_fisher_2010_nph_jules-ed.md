Fisher, R., McDowell, N., Purves, D., Moorcroft, P., Sitch, S., Cox, P., Huntingford, C., Meir, P. and Ian Woodward, F. (2010), Assessing uncertainties in a second‚Äêgeneration dynamic vegetation model caused by ecological scale limitations. **_New Phytologist_**, 187: 666-681. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03340.x

- **Question**:
  1. How demographic processes of two-dimensional spatial scales influence simulations of community structure, and responses of ecosystems to climate change?

- **Context**:
  - Recently second-generation DGVMs have become advanced in their capability to simulate short-term surface gas and energy exchanges and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.
  - However, the 2<sup>nd</sup> gen. DGVMs are still lack in representation of demographic processes because of insufficient observations.
  - This poor representations of competition and coexistence may bring uncertainties in simulation of the community structure and responses of ecosystem to climate change.

- **Answer**
  1. Varying the five unconstrained parameters (seed advection, seed mixing, sapling survival, competitive exclusion, and plant mortality) **introduced diverse predictions of community structure** ranging from monocultures to equal co-dominance of the seven PFTs.
  2. When exposed to a climate change scenario, the competing impacts of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization and increasing plant mortality **caused ecosystem biomass to diverge substantially** between simulations.

- **Implication**:
  - Demographic processes represent a large source of uncertainty in DGVM predictions.

- **Unanswered**:
  - Examining the uncertainties caused poor representations of demographic processes by top-down approach

- **Comment**: 
  - The uncertainties from demographic processes may show an interaction effect with other uncertainties (e.g. NSC, hydraulics, phenology, nutrient ...).
  - Attaching another module explicitly seems like a great way of preliminary test.
