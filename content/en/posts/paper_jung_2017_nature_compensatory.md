## 4 February, 2020 (Jung, Nature, Compensatory)

Jung, M., Reichstein, M., Schwalm, C. et al. Compensatory water effects link yearly global land CO<sub>2</sub> sink changes to temperature. ***Nature*** 541, 516-520 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20780

- **Question**:
  1. How do changes in temperature and water availability effect on gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at local and global scales?
- **Context**:
  - **Despite** temperature is known to contribute to the inter annual variation (IAV) of the terrestrial carbon cycle, several studies propose that **water availability play an important role** in the carbon cycle relates such as the carbon balance of semi-tropics and the sensitivity to IAV.
  - An understanding of the process behind **the climatic control of terrestrial carbon cycle** on interannual timescales and across spatial scales is **still lacking**.

- **Answer**
  1. At local scale (grid cell, ~ 50 km), water availability is the major driver of the IAV in GPP, TER, and NEE.
     - Temperature also have amplifying effect on NEE, but the magnitude is negligible.
  2. At global scale, temperature becomes the dominant driver of the IAV in GPP, TER, and NEE.
     - There seems **a local compensation mechanism**: Local variability in GPP and TER compensate locally, dampening water-driven NEE variability
     - There are **spatial compensations**: Spatial variability in water availability also compensates.

- **Implication**:
  - This study **reconciles** existing seemingly contradictory conclusions many studies (i.e. temperature vs water availability)
  - The apparent temperature-dominated IAV of the residual land sink **contains little information on local carbon-cycle processes**
  - The **spatial covariation of climate variables** drives the integrated global carbon-cycle response, as well as local one, and perhaps even **the strength of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks**.

- **Unanswered**:
  - Why temperature contributes little to the local-scale GPP and TER?
  - How does the local **compensation mechanism** occur?
    - The authors guessed that **the concomitant positive relationship** of soil moisture with productivity and with respiration was it (i.e. Both GPP and TER increase with SM, remaining NEE unchanged).
    - Then, **what are the differences** **between high GPP and TER** under pleasing SM condition **and** **low GPP and TER** under harsh SM condition? 
  - Is not there any mechanism that **offset the temperature effect**? **Does it make sense** that the temperature effect at global scale **remains without compensation**?

- **Comment**: 
  - Can we be sure that the water availability hardly affect the global scale productivity? Are there any other ways?
  - It is interesting and encouraging that the TRENDY results generally match those from FLUXCOM data although TRENDY showed under-/over-estimation to a certain degree.
  - It is also interesting how the authors took steps to solve their question and how they deal with the large set of locally gridded and global-scale data.
  - They suggested some explanations for their results, but it seems that this study **created many questions unsolved**, which values this study.
