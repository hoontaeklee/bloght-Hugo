## 14 October, 2020 (Gentine, erl, cw coupling)

Gentine, P., Green, J.K., Guérin, M., Humphrey, V., Seneviratne, S.I., Zhang, Y., *et al.* (2019). Coupling between the terrestrial carbon and water cycles—a review. *Environ. Res. Lett.*, 19. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab22d6



## Overview

The right topic for my project.

The authors wrote that this paper would be an introduction of the coupling of carbon and water cycles to people who are not familiar with. Indeed I think they summarized the topics nicely with well-organized structure. 

Here I would like to write down some points from each section in the paper.



## Atmosphric versus surface coupling

**GHG** effect and physiological responses of vegetation (e.g. **stomata**) convey atmospheric influences to changes in **energy, water, and carbon cycles** on the biosphere.



## Surface CO<sub>2</sub> effects on vegetation

The effect of [eCO<sub>2</sub>] over ecosystems were intensively investigated by the **FACE** (Free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment) experiments.

Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration [eCO<sub>2</sub>] typically:

- decreses stomatal conductance.
- increases CO<sub>2</sub> gradient between intercellular and leaf surface.
- increases biomass production (i.e. **greening**).
- alters belowground biomass (e.g. fine root). <-- **technically more challenging**
- resulted in taller with larger diameter, more branches and leaves.



C3 species are expected to more sensitive to [eCO<sub>2</sub>] then C4 species (photosynthesis and transpiration).

- C3 species uses RuBisCo as an enzyme for assimilation.
- C4 species adds another enzyme, PEP carboxylase. **They release CO<sub>2</sub> into the bundle sheat cells, where CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is pretty high even without [eCO<sub>2</sub>] condition**.



**Land management** could be the major cause of the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect has confirmed so far. 

- most of the observed greening across the globe appears to be located in regions of strong land management.



## Soil moisture effects on water-carbon coupling

- **SMC↓** --> **gs↓, cAlloc↑↓, embolism↑**
  - embolism: sap flow blockage due to air bublle formation in the xylem)
- **SMC↓** --> cell growth↓ (xylem and phloem) --> **Tr↓, GPP↓**
  - xylem sap water is used to replace transpired water in leaves
  - xylem and phloem interact through changes in osmotic pressure and water potential, regulating the water and carbohydrate transports in the plant.
- **SMC↓** --> cavitation↑ (--> defense↓) --> mortality↑ --> **Tr↓, GPP↓, Rh↑**
- **SMC↓** --> gs↓ --> ET↓ (--> H/ET↓) --> VPD↑, **Tsurf↑** --> gs↓
- **SMC↓** --> **sap conductivity↓** (of new xylem; transport efficiency)
  - at the expense of safety
- **SMC↓** --> solute transport↓ --> microbial activity↓ --> **Rh↓**
  - vs. **SMC↓** --> Esoil↓ --> Tsurf↑ --> **Rh↑**
  - SMC↑↑ --> O<sub>2</sub>↓ --> **Rh↑**



## VPD effects on vegetation

leaf-level (well understood) 

- VPD↑ --> gs↓
  - to **maximize GPP/Tr**, while **maintaining underlying WUE** (WUE VPD<sup>1/2</sup>)

**ecosystem-level (poorly understood)**

- Due to **the strong coupling between VPD and SMC**
  - the coupling limits carbon uptake and triggers mortality.
- VPD↑ --> fire↑ --> GPP↓



## Water use efficiency = GPP/Tr

Factors affecting WUE:

- [eCO<sub>2</sub>]
- VPD
- gm
- the degree of land-atmosphere coupling
  - ecosystem conductance
  - aerodynamic roughness

**The influence of soil moisture on long-term (year to decades) WUE has rarely been assessed, likely because of the callenges in continuously measuring and disentangling the effects of confounding factors such as VPD.**



## Extremes

Extremes (e.g. droughts and heat waves) substantially affect the terrestial water and carbon cycles:

- **Carbon cycle IAV, especially in transitional climates (monsoonal or semi-arid)**.
  - SMC and temperature are the key regulator on carbon uptake over the regions.
- **Legacy effect** (e.g. a large-scale die-off)
