## 18 September, 2020 (Humphrey, nature, TWS-[CO2])

Humphrey, V., Zscheischler, J., Ciais, P. *et al.* Sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 growth rate to observed changes in terrestrial water storage. *Nature* **560,** 628â€“631 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0424-4

## Overview

This paper provides **observational evidence** that **the inter-annual variation (IAV) of CO<sub>2</sub> growth rate (CGR) is strongly coupled to changes in both terrestrial water storage (TWS) and temperature at the global scale.** It uses GRACE product, satellite observations of TWS, and measurements of CGR from NOAA. In addition, the authors compares their results with those by Jung et al. (2017), which is a root of my PhD project. The comparison reveals that **the global CGR is more related to TWS rather than temperature, which counters Jung et al. (2017)'s results.** This contradictory is triggered by less sensitive response of DGVMs in the TRENDY project, calling further improvements.



Although confirming the global relationship between CGR IAV and TWS, **this study does not explain the mechanism behind the relationship.**


## CGR IAV is strongly sensitive to TWS at the global scale.

Figure 2:

- TWS shows a strong correlation with CGR.
- Temperature is more strongly correlated with CGR in tropics.
- ENSO is associated with large-scale fluctuations in precipitation, which ultimately translate into water storage anomalies.



## CGR IAV shows higher partial correlation with TWS than temperature.

Figure 3:

- The global CGR-TWS relationship remains significant after controlling for the effect of temperature (**b**, blue bars.
  - A 28% decrease (-0.93 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> per Tt H<sub>2</sub>O)
- The global CGR-Temperature shows more reduction after controlling for the effect of TWS (**b**, red bars).
  - A 49% decrease (1.99 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> per degC)
- Global yearly sensitivity is **-1.33 Gt C yr<sup>-1</sup> per Tt H<sub>2</sub>O** (= 1.3 g C yr<sup>-1</sup> per kg H2O)

## Models underestimate the magnitude of (soil) water-driven NEE IAV.

Figure 4:

- **a** models fails to reproduce the observed correlation between CGR and temperature (squares).
  - This leads to a different conclusion by Jung et al. (2017).
- **b, c** models underestimate the magnitude of (soil) water-driven NEE IAV.
  - Most DGVMs represent root zone soil water pool.
  - Weak representation of **water pools with much longer residence time** (e.g. deep soil layers, groundwater, wetlands, and surface water)
  - **Modelled NEE<sup>water</sup> has an upper limit.**
  - errors in the precipitation forcing
- Nevertheless, **models also show a global TWS-NEE<sup>water</sup> relationship, which supports the result here.**



## Methodology

### Data

- GRACE TWS
  - 2002 ~
  - monthly, ~300 km
  - relative changes in water storage
  - groundwater, soil moisture, surface waters, snow, land ice, and biosphere water pools
- GRACE-REC: a statistical reconstruction of GRACE to estimate past TWS anomalies.
  - forced with precipitation and temperature
- NOAA/ESRL
  - weekly GCR observation since 1980

### Analysis

- Isolate IAV: by removing seasonal cycle and the linear trend
- Land area analysis: to exclude Greenland and Antarctica
- Jung et al. (2017)'s method
