## 26 May, 2019 (Li, GCB, SIF)

Li, X., Xiao, J., He, B., Altaf Arain, M., Beringer, J., Desai, A.R., Emmel, C., Hollinger, D.Y., Krasnova, A., Mammarella, I., Noe, S.M., Ortiz, P.S., Rey-Sanchez, A.C., Rocha, A.V. and Varlagin, A. (2018). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is strongly correlated with terrestrial photosynthesis for a wide variety of biomes: First global analysis based on OCO-2 and flux tower observations. **_Global Change Biology_**, 24(9), 3990-4008.

This paper demonstrates that SIF is a strong proxy of terrestrial GPP using different point of view. Also, it shows that SIF is more strongly correlated with GPP than VIs (EVI, NDVI) and GPP estimates from LUE methods.  

GPP estimation using SIF from satellites is relatively new method, which started about a decade ago. But, it seems a very strong method because SIF can response sensitively to physiological changes in plants. Also, SIF method is becoming more powerful because SIF data from satellites is available. Moreover, the utility of the data will be better as the spatial resolution of the data will be finer.  

This method is a representative example of the potential of RS. Everytime a new algorithm for a new variable is added to satellites, satellite will observe the variable in a planet-scale scope. In addition, this method is a great example of application of physiological mechanism to the remote sensing algorithm.
