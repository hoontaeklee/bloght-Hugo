## 12 August, 2019 (Resco de Dios, AFM, FMC)

Resco de Dios, V., Fellows, A.W., Nolan, R.H., Boer, M.M., Bradstock, R.A., Domingo, F. and Goulden, M.L. (2015). A semi-mechanistic model for predicting the moisture content of fine litter. **_Agricultural and Forest Meteorology_**, 203, 64-73.   

I read this paper to get some hints for my fuel moisture research at NIFOS. This paper developed a semi-mechanistic model in which fuel moisture content (FMC) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were exponentially related. This model is able to be easily applied to other researches once VPD for target sites is known. Hence, contrary to my model, this model can be synergized with remote sensing VPD data sets to broaden the spatial scope of the model.  

I contemplate that I can include this model to compare with other models in my on-going paper. Also, it looks also a good idea to analyze additionally the model performance for lower FMC range because my research results will be incorporated to the fire danger rating system of NIFOS. On the other hand, FMC model of this paper poorly estimates FMC during late autumn and winter, and steadily underestimates the maximum FMC even it works well for other seasons. This result is also curious.
