## 18 May, 2019 (Fisher, ANN, TBM)

Fisher, J.B., Huntzinger, D.N., Schwalm, C.R. and Sitch, S. (2014). Modeling the terrestrial biosphere. **_Annual Review of Environment and Resources_**, 39, 91-123.

This paper synthesized in what context the terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) appeared, which processes TBMs included, and what's next. It was interesting that actually many part of the TBM was studied and developed separately around the world, and the development was accelerated after the parts were incorporated into a type of model.  

On top of that, there was about the JULES and ED. JULES deveolopers were proud of the structure and quality of the way it's source code. About the ED, it seemed to be valuable because the ED can simulate the heterogeneity of PFT composition in detail, which should depend on resource allocation equations or be simplified. Quillet et al. (2010)[^1], which is also a nice review paper of DGVM, agreed with this perspective. They described that ecosystem demographic modules such as ED can replace the PFT concept and resolve problems of it to a certain degree.
